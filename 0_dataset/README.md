As described in the paper, the `0_dataset` folder is divided into two sections,
- one for the public dataset `0_pub_dataset`,
- and one for the industrial dataset `1_industrial_dataset`. 
- `2_experiment_dataset`  are files involved in the author's execution of the code and are related to the code. There may be duplication with the first two files.
